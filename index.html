            <p> Hello, my name is Mitch. I am from Utah and have previously worked within game development with my
                previous
                degree. I am studying Software Development to get a more rounded set of skills to be able to further my
                career within tech. </p>
            <p>
                I have many hobbies but love programming on the side and will make computer games on the side. I also
                enjoy
                photography and exploring my local area to find new places to photograph. I am also very passionate
                about
                food,
                I enjoy cooking and baking, as well as hosting game nights with my friends.
            </p>

                Utah is a landlocked state in the Mountain West region known for its stunning natural landscapes,
                including
                Arches
                National Park, Zion National Park, and the Great Salt Lake. Historically, the state was inhabited by
                various
                Native
                American groups before becoming a destination for Mormon pioneers in 1847, eventually leading to its
                statehood in 1896.
                Today, Utah has a diverse economy and a population of over 3 million, with the majority living along the
                Wasatch Front.
