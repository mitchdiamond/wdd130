            Utah is a landlocked state in the Mountain West region known for its stunning natural landscapes, including
            Arches
            National Park, Zion National Park, and the Great Salt Lake. Historically, the state was inhabited by various
            Native
            American groups before becoming a destination for Mormon pioneers in 1847, eventually leading to its
            statehood in 1896.
            Today, Utah has a diverse economy and a population of over 3 million, with the majority living along the
            Wasatch Front.
